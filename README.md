# README
An MVC REST API which returns information about Cities - built from scratch.

The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamnetal of ASP.NET Core Web APIs with MVC. 

I work professionally at a large enterprise company that primarily uses .NET. After working for a year, despite being a top performer- I still
found myself to have low confidence in standing anything up from scratch within my own ecosystem. This seems to be a side-effect of working in a
large, legacy codebase. Rarely do I create and design an entire feature end to end - anything I build is created on top of layers and layers of legacy
code which abstracts the fundamentals away. 

It bothers me a lot that I can deliver full-stack React projects but I wouldn't have a clue as to where to start with .NET; it's time to fix that.

Goals:
- [x] Register API and stand up web server
- [x] Create API and return resources using the MVC pattern
- [x] Add CRUD endpoints
- [x] Use inversion of control and DI to register mail service
- [x] Log exceptions w/Serilog
- [x] Register in-memory datastore via DI
- [x] Add scoped configuration files
- [x] migrate in memory database to SQL Lite w//Entity Framework Core
- [x] seed database
- [x] introduce resository pattern to controllers
- [x] add automapper mapped DTOs
- [ ] create and remove resources with EF
- [ ] convert all in memory controllers to use EF
- [ ] Add search, filtering, and paging in API
- [ ] Add security
- [ ] ..... TBD
